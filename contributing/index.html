        <h1>Contribution Guidelines</h1>
        <p>We welcome anyone who would like to contribute to the guild.  There are many ways in which you can contribute.</p>

        <h2>General Contribution Guidelines</h2>

        <h3>Good Communication</h3>
        <p>Make sure you are giving progress updates for any contribution. With more communication, we can catch things earlier and help you develop using the conventions and practices that we have built-in. This will also ensure a much faster PR approval if we are on the same page the whole time.</p>

        <h3>Collaboration and Final Decisions</h3>
        <p>The guild welcomes your suggestions and contributions. This project works best as an open, cross-organization collaboration. Please bring your ideas and constructive criticism to the team and we can brainstorm, engage in healthy debate, and work together towards the best possible solution. The Lead and Co-leads of the guild will make (and own) final decisions regarding presentation topics, resource selection, build tools, coding style, and which work is the priority. Once a decision has been made, everyone involved needs to be willing to disagree and commit in the interest of moving forward.</p>

        <h2>Ways to Contribute</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Present a topic in a guild meeting</li>
            <li>Bugs or mistakes</li>
            <li>Documentation improvements</li>
            <li>Suggest additional resources</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Present a topic in a guild meeting</h2>
        <p>If you have an idea for a presentation topic fill out the form for the guild to review.  The guild will reach out to you to for further planning.  If you do not want to personally present the topic, the topic will go into the backlog for someone to pick up.</p>

        <h2>Bugs and Mistake Contributions</h2>
        <p>If you find a bug of piece of documentation needing updating, open a ticket for the guild to address, or you can fix the issue yourself and submit your own pull request.</p>

        <h2>Suggesting Additional Resource Contributions</h2>
        <p>If you have any resources (books, Udemy course, podcast, etc.) you think would be beneficial for people, reach out to the guild lead, explaining how your suggestion will add value.</p>
